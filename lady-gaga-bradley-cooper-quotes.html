In the lead-up to the Academy Awards, the pair shared a series of praise for each other and their experience filming A Star Is Born. And when they finally took the stage on Oscars night to perform “Shallow,” in a stripped-back set with only a piano and the two of them in the spotlight, audiences were once again reminded of the connection that the pair have built over the course of their time working together.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here are excerpts of their best quotes about each other.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On meeting for the first time:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I was at a cancer benefit with my mother,” Cooper <a href=# rel=noopener>told W Magazine</a> of first seeing Lady Gaga perform. “I really did not know Lady Gaga’s music. They had a surprise musical guest, and Stefani came out with her hair slicked back, and she sang ‘La Vie en Rose.’ I was blown away… I called her agent the next day and said, ‘Can I go to her house and meet her right away?’ I drove to Malibu, and we sat on her porch, and the next thing I know, I’m eating spaghetti and meatballs, and I said, ‘Can we sing a song together?’”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“From the moment we met, I felt a kindred spirit in him,” Lady Gaga <a href=#>told TIME</a>. “And as soon as I heard him sing, I stopped dead in my tracks. I knew he could play a rock star. Actually, he’s the only actor on the planet who could play this one.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“She entrusted me with giving herself so she could reveal herself to be the actress that she is,” Cooper <a href=#>told TIME</a>, “and I entrusted her that I would be able to become the musician that I was terrified to be.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On their chemistry together:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s one of those things,” Lady Gaga told <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Weekly</a> about their chemistry. “And I think also we’re both from the East Coast.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We both have an Italian upbringing,” Cooper added in the same interview. “Our families are very similar.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Gaga went on: “Before I knew it, I was making him spaghetti and meatballs. It felt right. I was really kind of willing to do anything to show the studio and to show him that I had what it took to play this role.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On how close they’ve become:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“She knows everything about me — everything. There is not one thing she doesn’t know, and I believe the same for me,” Cooper <a href=# rel=noopener>told EW</a>. “It’s just so funny how life works. It’s like, ‘So in five years you guys will be inseparably close.'”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I love her so deeply,” Cooper also <a href=#>told TIME</a> about Gaga. “It’s because we were at our most vulnerable together.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The whole thing is that these two people found each other and it is a pure love. And it is easier when you have somebody with you going down the road. And I had that with Stefani going down this road. I can’t imagine having the courage to do it without her,” Cooper <a href=# rel=noopener>further explained</a> at the Toronto Film Festival.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This entire experience was life-changing… I don’t know that I’ve ever had a closer artistic relationship than I have had with Bradley, a closer exchange,” Gaga said at the same event. “It meant a lot to me, and I think to both of us, that at the beginning of making this film we kind of shook hands literally and he said, ‘You are an actress.’ I said to him, ‘You are a musician.’”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Lady Gaga on Bradley Cooper’s talents:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I mean, when I heard that Bradley was attached to A Star Is Born and that he would not only be starring in it but that he would be directing it, I was so excited because I was already such a huge fan of him as a brilliant actor. I just knew that whatever he was gonna do was gonna be an explosion of his talent. I couldn’t believe that he wanted me to be the girl,” Lady Gaga said to EW.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“He sings from his soul. He sings from his gut. There are people who can do many acrobatics with their voice, but to tell a story with his voice is a different animal,” Gaga <a href=# rel=noopener>told an audience</a> at the Toronto Film Festival. “That was us singing together for the first time—we were laughing, harmonizing, singing… The truth is, I made this film with Bradley because I believe in him as a filmmaker, an actor, as a screenwriter, as a musician. He has it all in spades, and I just feel very privileged to be here onstage with you tonight.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I am so glad you are going to see the movie,” Gaga also told reporters. “But in a way, I wish I could give you what we all got to experience working for him, because it really was an honor and a privilege to witness.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Bradley Cooper on Lady Gaga’s talents:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Lady Gaga is just kind of a revelation,” Cooper told Robert De Niro <a href=# rel=noopener>during a conversation</a> at the Tribeca Film Festival. “She said right from the beginning that this was going to be a bargain. ‘I’m gonna rely on you to get a performance that’s honest out of me,’ because she’d never done a film before, ‘and I’m gonna make sure you that turn into a musician, because we’re going to sing everything live.’… And she’s right. So that was terrifying, but I really relied on her.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“She leveled the entire room when she came out,” Cooper said <a href=# rel=noopener>at the Toronto Film Festival</a>, recalling seeing Lady Gaga perform “La Vie En Rose” at a benefit — the moment he decided she needed to be his star. “It was insane. And I thought, right then, that song is in the movie.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m just so glad God gave her the talent that she has and he chose her because that’s quite a vessel to go through,” Cooper told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Morning America</a> about Lady Gaga. “Because it’s really what you do with it, and she’s such a beautiful human being.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“No actress can do musically what I needed Stefani to do in 42 days of shooting: I needed plutonium. And the plutonium in A Star Is Born is Stefani’s voice,” Cooper told <a href=# rel=noopener>W Magazine.</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On the filming process:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It was up and down,” Lady Gaga told EW of her time on set. “But you know what? I have an incredible director and friend and lead actor, and I had him by my side the whole time and we did it.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">On working together in the future:</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“That would be amazing,” Cooper told EW.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“If I’m lucky enough,” Lady Gaga also told EW.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubWNsfnV%2FjqWYnbFdnK6orYybqZqcnJrGbq%2FOqKeeql2mwrDAxKxm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ben-afflecks-new-look-sparks-controversy-and-people-think-jennifer-lopez-is-to-blame-818718.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ben Afflecks New Look Sparks Controversy, and People Think Jennifer Lopez Is to Blame">&larr;
