Read our analysis below of what people taking part had to say.</b></h3><h3>VIEWPOINT: Individuals applying for UK citizenship SHOULD have to learn the first verse of our National Anthem to pass the test</h3><h3><b>A slightly higher proportion of those participating in the open poll agreed applicants SHOULD have to learn the first verse of ‘God Save the Queen’.</b></h3><ul><li>Here, participants cited <b>‘integration into society’</b> as one of the main reasons why applicants should learn the first verse, with many of you telling us the song is an <b>important part of being and feeling ‘British’</b></li><li>Most participants argued that <b>learning the National Anthem was a clear way for immigrants to show respect and dedication to the country</b> they wished to become a part of, as the National Anthem is a crucial part of British culture.</li><li>Pride in the British monarchy and cultural heritage was widely expressed - you felt that <b>acknowledging British traditions was important for those individuals seeking UK citizenship</b></li><li>Some of you said that learning the National Anthem <b>demonstrated knowledge of the English language</b>, which you perceived as important, thinking about those applying for Citizenship</li></ul><p>“If they are applying for UK citizenship, then <b>they are accepting the Queen as the Head of their adopted country and as such should learn the first verse</b> – this should not be questioned” <i>Sasha, Somerset</i></p><p>“<b>To prove they and family members can speak the English language</b>. Today some cultures living in the UK cannot speak English” <i>Anon, Norfolk</i></p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/HP-size-Choirboys_DcmWgXA.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“Being a citizen is more than just holding a passport. <b>If someone wants to be part of a country, they should know vital details.</b> I believe people applying for US citizenship must know the pledge of allegiance. However, most UK citizens don't know any of the information included in the UK citizenship test. I have a number of friends who do the online practice test and failed. The requirements should be consistent between the two parts of the population” <i>MS, London</i></p><p>“<b>If anyone wants to live in this country (or any other) as a permanent resident it would be right and proper that they learnt/or taught the National Anthem of that country.</b> After all, they are declaring their preference to dwell in the country as a citizen of the country. If you are not prepared to declare your allegiance, you shouldn't be allowed to live there” <i>Jim S, Leeds</i></p><p>“Any person wishing to permanently live in the UK should seek to learn about and support our culture, whatever their previous background, culture or religion. <b>They should not be granted permanent leave to remain until they can speak English, have a knowledge of our laws, customs, history, culture and accept our way of life.</b> The anthem is a symbol of our nationality, together with our flag. A comprehensive knowledge of both should be required”<i> David C</i></p><p>“Surely, when immigrants come to Britain to draw our benefit scheme, the <b>least they can do is learn some respect for those of us who support them and learn our National Anthem?”</b> <i>JD</i></p><p>“I had to learn it at school and it is part of what makes me British and for some strange reason that I do not fully understand, gives me a pride in my country. <b>People coming to live here from foreign cultures should follow the old saying of "When in Rome do as the Romans do".</b> They should not come here and expect us to change our way of life for them, for they are coming here because our lifestyle and economics are attractive to them” <i>David, Worcs</i></p><p>“If you choose to become a UK citizen <b>you should have a good understanding of the culture, custom and practice of your adopted country.</b> If I went to live in another country I would learn their National Anthem” <i>Jayne M, Bristol</i></p><p>“Show a <b>willingness to become British by being involved in ALL of our culture and traditions</b> – 'when in Rome do as the Romans do'!!!!” <i>Maureen, S18</i></p><h3>VIEWPOINT: Individuals applying for UK citizenship should NOT have to learn the first verse of our National Anthem to pass the test</h3><ul><li>Overwhelmingly, those holding this viewpoint <b>had issues with the National Anthem itself, thinking it irrelevant</b> and/or unimportant in everyday life</li><li><b>You admitted that lots of you didn’t know the first verse</b>, so it was hardly fair to expect foreign nationals to do so</li><li>Many <b>did not value</b> learning the first verse of the song <b>as a reasonable test</b> to gain UK citizenship</li><li>Some cited there are <b>many more important tests</b> that individuals should undertake if they wish to become UK citizens – or suggested the introduction of a UK ‘allegiance test’ – wherein new citizens swear to adopt the nation’s ‘values’</li></ul><p>“The <b>National Anthem is NOT an important part of life in the UK</b>; the test should be to see if the person has the understanding and language skills needed to survive and interact in everyday UK life” <i>Damian S, South Wales</i></p><p>“<b>Patriotism is not a requirement of citizenship</b>. More importantly, our national anthem is an outmoded disgrace. Even if you accept that the royal family is a good thing for this country, it invokes a Christian god in a multicultural, secular society. <b>Asking people of other faiths to invoke a heathen God is unacceptable”</b><i> Anon</i></p><p><b>“I don't know the first verse of the national anthem and I've lived here all my life.</b> I don't see how it's relevant to anybody’s life” <i>Anon</i></p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/HP-Queen_97NQ35c.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>“The National Anthem is an outdated, purely English piece of very dull and uninspiring music. Utterly irrelevant to modern UK” <i>Nigel, Farnborough</i></p><p>“What moron thought this up? <b>Migrants to this country should bring a skill we lack and the financial wherewithal to support themselves without state aid for five years, that’s it</b>. Everything else is fluff.” <i>Jim, Leeds</i></p><p>“I think it would be better if they learned the price of a return ticket and the way back to the airport – we're already too crowded” <i>Anon</i></p><p><b>“That is the least important part of entering our society. </b>In my opinion it is more important that they are prepared to adopt British values relative to Law and Order and be prepared to reasonably accept decisions made by the Government and avoid attempting to make Britain like the country they have left.” <i>Johnboy, Houston</i></p><p>“It proves nothing and it's too easy to fake. <b>Better to have a sworn declaration of the values that we pride ourselves in</b> – things like tolerance and fairness to all minorities.” <i>Ealingman, London</i></p><h2><b>From the list of topics and key figures in British history and culture that reports indicated might be included in the revised examination, we asked our panellists to tell us which they would struggle to answer questions on most.</b></h2><ul><li><b><span>Thomas Gainsborough</span></b>,<b> </b>the 18th Century portrait and landscape painter, was chosen by the highest proportion of participants as the historical figure they would struggle to pass questions on.</li><li><b><span>Robert Browning</span></b>, the Victorian-era poet, was chosen by nearly as many of you as someone you would have difficulty answering questions about on the citizenship test.</li><li><b><span>J.M.W. Turner</span></b>, who was a landscape painter and is seen as one of the key forerunners of the Impressionism art movement, was the historical figure that the third highest proportion of participants said would be a challenge to answer questions about.</li><li>The historical figures that the <i>smallest proportion</i> of you told us you would struggle to answer questions about were: <b>Queen Elizabeth II, William Shakespeare, The Beatles, and Florence Nightingale</b>.</li></ul><h2><b>We then invited you to explore the underlying principles of the Life in the UK test: whether or not the test should require applicants to know more about Britain’s cultural and historical underpinnings, with less of an emphasis on individual rights and practicalities of day-to-day living in the UK.</b></h2><p>Talking about the changes to the handbook and test, a Home Office official <a href=#>said</a>: "It's a move away from the old one – stuff on rights, practical info that has little to do with British culture – to one that is clear about responsibilities and requires people to have a grounding in our history."</p><p>However, Bernard Crick, the professor who wrote the introduction to the first ‘Life in the UK handbook’, said in 2006 that he had resisted including history questions in the test, “both in principle and on grounds of practicality: could any test for immigrants be devised that 80% of our fellow citizens would not fail?"</p><h2><b>We invited you to tell us which view you support most.</b></h2><h3>VIEWPOINT: Individuals taking the UK citizenship test should NOT have to answer questions about British history and culture<strong></strong></h3><h2>The highest proportion of those who took part in the debate agreed with Bernard Crick’s view.</h2><ul><li><b>Mr Crick’s point that the majority of citizens who were born and bred in Britain would not be able to answer questions about British history and culture themselves</b>, is what resonated most with those who agreed with him. Some queried whether UK-born citizens should be required to take the test themselves, to illustrate what they saw the proposed test topics as unnecessary hurdles.</li><li>Many of you said that <b>the topics that will reportedly be included in the citizenship test were largely ‘irrelevant’ to day-to-day life in the UK, </b>and that the<b> test should focus on practical things </b>that immigrants should to know to help navigate living in Britain.</li><li><b>You said that someone’s level of historical knowledge should not be a determinant as to whether they are a good or bad citizen.</b></li><li><b>Participants also took issue on principle with the idea of </b>Theresa May and<b> the Home Office choosing which bits of history and culture would be deemed essential </b>knowledge for those hoping to obtain UK citizenship. There were some accusations that the history covered by the new test handbook would be prescriptive, skewed, politically, and even too ‘intellectual’. What matters is the character of the individual coming to the UK – not their general knowledge of the Isles, was the sentiment:</li></ul><p class=odd>“A test for Citizenship should be a test which current citizens can pass. <b>Rather than general knowledge about the UK's past, would it not be better to ask practical questions about current life in the UK?</b> Questions about TV licence, paying for gas and electricity, direct debits and banking, and renting property – this is knowledge which UK citizens do have and would pass. <b>The Government has it wrong</b>” <i>Andrew S, Leeds</i></p><p class=even>“<b>Are you going to make current citizens take the test?
