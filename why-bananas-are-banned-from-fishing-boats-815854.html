But many people still believe in&nbsp;them. All these things make sense if&nbsp;you find out their origin. Let’s look at&nbsp;eleven most famous <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>superstitions</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/13d/4d1/de082851b0adeab06e516b948c.png><p>A&nbsp;football match, a&nbsp;business project presentation, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;tricky exam is&nbsp;coming. You’re afraid of&nbsp;failing and, therefore, knock on&nbsp;wood. People in&nbsp;Europe and the U.S. have been preserving this ritual for over two thousand years to&nbsp;avoid trouble. Knocking on&nbsp;wood to&nbsp;prevent disappointment could originate among peasants who knocked on&nbsp;tree trunks to&nbsp;scare away evil spirits who wanted to&nbsp;spoil people’s lives.</p><p>Some people are afraid to&nbsp;walk under a&nbsp;leaning ladder. And if&nbsp;you ask them what the reason for such fear&nbsp;is, they probably won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;answer you. The superstition that passing under a&nbsp;ladder can lead to&nbsp;failure appeared about five thousand years ago in&nbsp;Ancient Egypt. The pyramids were triangular because the Egyptians considered this form sacred.</p><p>A&nbsp;leaning ladder also has a&nbsp;triangle shape, so&nbsp;walking under it&nbsp;felt like a&nbsp;desecration of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sacred symbol. In&nbsp;other cultures, such a&nbsp;ladder meant evil, misfortune, and betrayal. And in&nbsp;the seventeenth century in&nbsp;England, guards forced prisoners to&nbsp;pass under ladders.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/fef/0b1/c7a8c853a7ab0219bc9f3c4fcd.png><p>One of&nbsp;the most famous bad signs is&nbsp;a&nbsp;broken mirror. To&nbsp;see yourself in&nbsp;its shards means failure for the next seven years. Even visually, the reflection in&nbsp;broken glass seems ominous, so&nbsp;many people are afraid to&nbsp;look there. But historically, this fear originated in&nbsp;Ancient Greece, where many people came to&nbsp;special mystics who knew how to&nbsp;predict the future using a&nbsp;mirror image.</p><p>If&nbsp;someone’s reflection was distorted, then trouble awaited this person. A&nbsp;broken or&nbsp;cracked mirror also distorted the image, so&nbsp;people were afraid to&nbsp;look there. Then, in&nbsp;the first century&nbsp;CE, the Romans added the detail about seven years of&nbsp;misfortune to&nbsp;the superstition. The inhabitants of&nbsp;the Empire believed that human health changed every seven years, so&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;a&nbsp;distorted reflection meant precisely this period. And the Romans also believed that mirrors reflected particles of&nbsp;our souls. So, if&nbsp;you broke a&nbsp;mirror, it&nbsp;meant you were hurting your soul.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Spilled salt</a>? Throw a&nbsp;pinch of&nbsp;it&nbsp;over your shoulder right away if&nbsp;you don’t want trouble. Why can salt bring trouble and, at&nbsp;the same time, help avoid&nbsp;it? The answer lies partly in&nbsp;the name. The words salt and salary are similar because both of&nbsp;these things are valuable. In&nbsp;the past, salt was an&nbsp;expensive product. Spilling it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the floor meant throwing money away.</p><p>Over three thousand years ago, the ancient Sumerians were the first to&nbsp;throw salt over their shoulders to&nbsp;cancel misfortune. Then, the tradition passed to&nbsp;the Egyptians, Assyrians, and Greeks. In&nbsp;Europe, it&nbsp;was believed that when you threw a&nbsp;pinch of&nbsp;salt over your left shoulder, you blinded an&nbsp;evil spirit who wanted to&nbsp;cause you trouble. Now, salt doesn’t seem valuable, so&nbsp;only a&nbsp;few people believe in&nbsp;this superstition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f62/b38/89f8a6523b824503dd0cb24eb3.png><p>Sailors in&nbsp;the past were in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dangerous position when they went out to&nbsp;sea. No&nbsp;wonder they began to&nbsp;believe in&nbsp;all sorts of&nbsp;superstitions. And one of&nbsp;the most popular ones was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>related to&nbsp;bananas</a>. Keeping the yellow fruit on&nbsp;board was believed to&nbsp;cause serious problems at&nbsp;sea. This superstition appeared in&nbsp;the eighteenth century when merchant ships leaving the Caribbean and Spain began to&nbsp;disappear. People who found shipwrecks said that bananas had been floating among the wooden planks. Thus, these fruits became messengers of&nbsp;disaster.</p><p>Storms, pirates, sea monsters&nbsp;— anything could happen to&nbsp;a&nbsp;ship if&nbsp;bananas were on&nbsp;board. Some anglers are sure that bananas can spoil fishing. And this superstition has a&nbsp;scientific basis. Bananas emit a&nbsp;special gas that may be&nbsp;unpleasant to&nbsp;fish. Perhaps marine life can sense bananas from afar and doesn’t want to&nbsp;swim close to&nbsp;them. These days, many sailors believe in&nbsp;the negative energy coming from bananas, too. So&nbsp;don’t be&nbsp;surprised if&nbsp;you won’t be&nbsp;allowed on&nbsp;the boat with this fruit in&nbsp;your hand.</p><p>Have you ever noticed a&nbsp;horseshoe hanging on&nbsp;the front door of&nbsp;some houses? Of&nbsp;course, many people hang it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;decoration and don’t attach importance to&nbsp;its meaning. However, since ancient times, it&nbsp;has been considered an&nbsp;effective talisman for scaring away bad spirits. Also, the horseshoe was a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;good luck in&nbsp;many cultures. All these beliefs first appeared in&nbsp;Ancient Greece, where iron was considered a&nbsp;material that protected from evil.</p><p>Also, the Greeks made horseshoes in&nbsp;the crescent moon form because it&nbsp;symbolized <a href=# title=fertility data-link=tag>fertility</a> and good luck. Then, this belief passed to&nbsp;the Romans and, after that, to&nbsp;Europe. People feared witches, sorcerers, and other mythical creatures in&nbsp;the Middle Ages, so&nbsp;they hung horseshoes in&nbsp;every house. They were sure that witches were afraid of&nbsp;horses, so&nbsp;they would avoid any objects related to&nbsp;these animals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b63/a22/5290035185b9fe13df933b92e4.png><p>If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;avoid problems, don’t open your umbrella indoors. This is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the few superstitions that have practical significance. For the first time, people started talking about it&nbsp;in&nbsp;Victorian England. At&nbsp;that time, umbrellas were tougher and more dangerous than now. Iron spokes could injure someone or&nbsp;break something. All these troubles could also provoke quarrels with the people you lived with, so&nbsp;no&nbsp;one opened umbrellas inside.</p><p>A&nbsp;black cat running across the road is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most famous superstitions. Some believe this is&nbsp;an&nbsp;omen of&nbsp;good luck. Others believe that it&nbsp;promises misfortune. The two versions have two different sources. In&nbsp;Ancient Egypt, cats were sacred animals, and people revered them. Therefore, it&nbsp;was lucky for an&nbsp;Egyptian to&nbsp;see a&nbsp;black cat crossing their path.</p><p>In&nbsp;the Middle Ages, these animals frightened people because they believed the black cat was a&nbsp;witches’ companion and a&nbsp;talisman of&nbsp;dark forces. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;black cat crossed the road, it&nbsp;meant that evil was watching you. When the pilgrims settled in&nbsp;the New World, this superstition began to&nbsp;spread throughout America, and many people still believe in&nbsp;it.</p><p>Another animal mentioned in&nbsp;many superstitions is&nbsp;the magpie. This bird is&nbsp;known for stealing jewelry items and coins, so&nbsp;people consider it&nbsp;a&nbsp;harbinger of&nbsp;failure. People say when they see&nbsp;it, “Good morning, Mr. Magpie. How’s your lady wife today?” Many believe these words banish failures from them. A&nbsp;magpie chooses one partner for life, so&nbsp;if&nbsp;you see a&nbsp;magpie without a&nbsp;mate, it&nbsp;means it’s very lonely. Mentioning its partner may sadden the bird, and it&nbsp;won’t play dirty tricks on&nbsp;you.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7f0/782/a9ebe352af934a59348162785f.png><p>The fear associated with the number thirteen is&nbsp;so&nbsp;prevalent worldwide that it&nbsp;even got its own name&nbsp;— triskaidekaphobia. In&nbsp;the modern world, people fear this number because of&nbsp;pop culture. Movies, books, and&nbsp;TV shows say this number is&nbsp;associated with evil, troubles, and dangers. Still, no&nbsp;statistics can prove that thirteen is&nbsp;an&nbsp;unlucky number. There have been no&nbsp;accidents related to&nbsp;the number thirteen. People born on&nbsp;the thirteenth day feel great and have no&nbsp;health problems.</p><p>But then, where did we&nbsp;get this fear from? The origins of&nbsp;triskaidekaphobia refer&nbsp;us to&nbsp;Scandinavian mythology. There’s one legend about Valhalla where twelve guests were invited to&nbsp;a&nbsp;great feast in&nbsp;Asgard: Odin, Thor, and other famous characters. But then Loki burst into the hall uninvited and became the thirteenth guest who ruined the party. So, thirteen became a&nbsp;number that can ruin your life.</p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Why is&nbsp;finding a&nbsp;four-leaf clover</a> considered a&nbsp;harbinger of&nbsp;good luck? The probability of&nbsp;finding this plant is&nbsp;one in&nbsp;ten thousand, and you must be&nbsp;lucky to&nbsp;find&nbsp;it. But beyond that, the four-leaf clover has an&nbsp;interesting legend about its origin. It&nbsp;says Eve took a&nbsp;four-leaf clover to&nbsp;remember the Garden of&nbsp;Eden when she was expelled from Paradise. Thus, the plant has become a&nbsp;symbol of&nbsp;prosperity, good luck, and happiness.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYybmKeZnpbAbq3RnmSbmZ6jsqV5xaumpmWWnsCptc2gZJunkanAboSQbm9ubF8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./older-couples-great-relationships.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Older Couples Have Great Relationships">&larr;
