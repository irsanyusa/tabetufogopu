Rose would allegedly call Godfrey-Ryan, then 21, late at night and early in the morning to tell her his fantasies of watching her swim naked in his pool or ask her about her sex life.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"I had no desire to allow my identity to be public in this story," she wrote. "I do not revisit this time in my life often and I felt no need to take anyone down."</p><p>But after reading excerpts of interviews with other women allegedly victimized by Rose, she had a change of heart.</p><p>"These stories helped me reframe my perspective. I felt that by withholding my identity, I was de-legitimatizing the experiences of these other women," she wrote. "I couldn’t be complicit in what silence meant for them, so I allowed my name to run with the story."</p><p>Godfrey-Ryan was one of two women who were named in the Post story.</p><p>Godfrey-Ryan, now the founder of a meditation studio, said she recognized, upon revisiting her experiences working for Rose, how damaged her self-esteem had been when she was younger and how society supports "layers of abuse."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"When I was in my early 20s my self-worth was decimated, even before working at the show," she wrote, "and that is a major contributing factor to why I stayed in an abusive situation as long as I did."</p><p>Godfrey-Ryan reported the unwanted touching and sexual advances to Yvette Vega, Rose’s executive producer. But Vega dismissed her concerns, brushing them off as "just Charlie being Charlie."</p><p>"She just made me feel like I was being a dramatic little girl," Godfrey-Ryan said.</p><p>She eventually confided her story to a friend, who also knew Rose. After the friend told Rose about her complaint, Rose fired Godfrey-Ryan, telling her he was embarrassed by the accusations, which he said were unfair.</p><p>The former assistant went back to finish college at Columbia University and abandoned her nascent career in journalism.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p7z6ijoqyZmMBwvM6loK2hk6h6sLrEZqafZZOdrrO4yJ5kq6ejmsBurcKcrKydoqh6psTPpZiipqNixKnFjKyfnmWUmrCqsMSdZK2nXZeybrrAppydZaedsq950qhmn6uiori0fQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./remembering-john-aniston-how-the-hollywood-legend-repaired-his-relationship-with-daughter-jennifer-after-years-of-not-talking-809899.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Remembering John Aniston: How the Hollywood Legend Repaired His Relationship With Daughter Jennifer ">&larr;
