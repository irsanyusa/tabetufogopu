By carefully using the principles of ecology, we can learn to predict, extinguish, counteract and prevent potentially adverse effect we might have on the globe around us. Come study ecology at one of the Czech universities!</p><p>Ecology enriches our world and is crucial for human wellbeing and prosperity as provides new knowledge of the interdependence between people and nature that is vital for food production, maintaining clean air and water, and sustaining biodiversity in a changing climate.</p><p>Governments and citizens around the world are increasingly aware of the consequences of atmospheric pollution and climate change. Ecology involves use of scientific methodology via lab experiments to understands how the different organisms grow, populate, how they interact with other organisms either as parasites, predators, how the organisms die out as well as how they evolve or adapt to changing climatic and environmental situations.</p><h3><strong>Bachelor study of Ecology at </strong><strong>University od Hradec Králové</strong></h3><p>This 3-year bachelor study programme is focused on biological and ecological sciences is the basis for continuation of the follow-up master study of the degree program Biology and Ecology. Therefore, it is necessary that during the course of bachelor study students acquire sufficiently deep theoretical knowledge and practical skills that they will be able to extend and build on in the future.</p><p>The main goal of the field is to develop the ability of students to penetrate the substance of the subject matter, to study the new substance independently, and to transmit the acquired knowledge comprehensively to others. Subjects in each semester cover areas related to molecular and cell biology, botany, zoology and ecology, as well as fundamentals of chemistry, mathematics and physics. Legislation in nature conservation, biotechnology and methodological biological disciplines is an important part of the study. The study contains a lot of practical and field exercises so that students not only gain theoretical but also practical knowledge and skills. The study is completed with a bachelor exam in biology and ecology and defense of a bachelor thesis of a scientific and research character.</p><h3><strong>Master study of Tropical Crop Management and Ecology at </strong><a href=#><strong>Czech University of Life Sciences Prague</strong></a></h3><p>Tropical Crop Management and Ecology (TCME) is a two-year Master’s study programme taught in English. The aim of the program is to create professionals for the next generation needed to address challenges closely tied to the sustainability of tropical</p><p>and subtropical agricultural systems, biodiversity conservation, nutrition and human health, and climate change through interdisciplinary approaches in plant sciences.</p><p>Specific objectives of the program include seeking answers to plant resources use and management in tropical agroecosystems and adjacent natural ecosystems as well as food, nutritional and health related questions; promoting needed research and development activities related to tropical plant resources for food and agriculture; and providing graduates with the knowledge and skills needed for sound scientific inquiry and professional practice, and a solid understanding and commitment to professional ethics in tropical agriculture research and development.</p><h3><strong>Master study of Ecology at Charles University</strong></h3><p>The study of Master degree in ecology is open for any student who accomplished an adequate training on bachelor level (i.e. biological sciences or fields as environmental studies, agriculture, water management etc.). The 2-year study programme consists of two specialized fields (though a combination of both his possible upon request):</p><p>· Terrestrial Ecology</p><p>· Aquatic Ecology (Hydrobiology)</p><p>Curriculum of Aquatic Ecology provides an advanced education and erudition both in theoretical and practical aspects of aquatic ecology. The study is focused mainly on freshwater systems but also covers marine topics to some extent. A MSc. graduate is fully competent and skilled to apply for positions in research institutes or in applied fields (drinking water treatments, hygiene, sewage water plants) as well as in biological labs, monitoring surveys, conservation, etc.</p><p>Curriculum of Terrestrial Ecology provides an advanced education and erudition in terrestrial and evolutionary ecology. Graduates are fully competent for jobs in applied fields (conservation biology, pest regulation etc.) as well as for positions in research institutes. The curricula are based both on regular lectures and practical training in labs and in a field.</p><h3><strong>Master study of Ecology at </strong><a href=#><strong>University of South Bohemia in České Budějovice</strong></a></h3><p>A new 2-year Master’s study programme in Ecology has started in 2019, with the admission of students at each semester. The programme is an extension of the successful Quantitative Ecology Module lead by prof. Jan Lepš since 2011. Students will be trained in modern ecology research. The courses are focused on ecological theory and analysis as well as interpretation of ecological data using modern computational approaches. The workload is about five courses per semester. Strong emphasis is laid on the students‘ own research; almost half the credits are awarded for a research project to be conducted throughout the entire two years of study, and will be the basis of the Master Thesis.</p><p>Students will develop their critical thinking, acquire strong statistical foundations, excellent field skills, learn how to present their research or how to write successful grants. In addition, several field trips and practical-nature-conservation courses are included, broadening the experience and skills of the student.</p><h3><strong>Ph.D. study of Ecology at Charles University</strong></h3><p>The core of Ph.D. study in Ecology is a research project aimed at original scientific papers. The project should focus at a well-defined problem in ecological research, with clear testable hypotheses. It must have a competent supervisor and adequate funding must be secured. The resulting thesis should be composed from a minimum of three manuscripts or papers suitable for international peer-reviewed journals, accompanied by a general introduction. At least one of the manuscripts must be published or accepted in a journal covered by ISI Web of Science, the impact factor of which exceeds 1; alternatively, two papers accepted in journals with the impact factor exceeding 0.5 may be presented. The PhD candidate must be the first author of at least one of the accepted papers. (Note: Most theses recently defended at the department substantially exceeded the minimum requirements outlined above.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMbEnJ%2BuppmrsrO%2FyK2gnqtemLyue8Crq6KbnJp8tMDUnbCippditq9506GcZpuqmrCpedGep66anJ6wbrHCqKOon6k%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./100000-emplois-industriels-supprimes-depuis-le-debut-de-la-crise.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="100.000 emplois industriels supprims depuis le dbut de la crise">&larr;
