It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;challenging to&nbsp;determine whether their success is&nbsp;attributed to&nbsp;their own efforts or&nbsp;the fame of&nbsp;their family. To&nbsp;avoid this confusion, <a href=# title="Nicolas Cage" data-link=tag>Nicolas Cage</a> even chose to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>change </a>his surname, Coppola, to&nbsp;establish his own success and recognition.</p><p><h2>Heath Ledger</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/045/72d/b3edb95c4b8e9b42a3e58b6a5d.jpg><p>The daughter of&nbsp;the late actor <a href=# title="Heath Ledger" data-link=tag>Heath Ledger</a>, Matilda, was not initially included in&nbsp;her father’s inheritance as&nbsp;he&nbsp;had written his will <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>prior </a>to&nbsp;her birth. After Ledger’s passing in&nbsp;2008, his property was distributed among his three sisters and parents. Nevertheless, the Ledger family acted ethically and transferred all of&nbsp;Heath’s funds to&nbsp;his young daughter, who was only two years old at&nbsp;the time.</p><p><h2>David Cassidy</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d7b/6be/8707405980b08f47527e52d938.jpg><p>Actor David Cassidy provides a&nbsp;notable example of&nbsp;unequal treatment between children. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated </a>that he&nbsp;did not consider himself to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;father to&nbsp;his daughter Katie Cassidy, who was known for her role in&nbsp;the popular&nbsp;TV series <i>Gossip Girl</i>.</p><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, he&nbsp;referred to&nbsp;his son, who he&nbsp;raised, as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the finest individuals he&nbsp;had ever met. After Cassidy’s death, it&nbsp;was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed </a>that he&nbsp;did not bequeath any inheritance to&nbsp;his daughter, and all his assets were transferred to&nbsp;his son.</p><p><h2>Daniel Craig</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/329/a0c/e9549c5eb68f46c2bb7fe59dc3.jpg><p>The actor who brought agent 007 to&nbsp;life is&nbsp;a&nbsp;wealthy person, with an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>estimated </a>net worth of&nbsp;approximately $160&nbsp;million, mostly earned from his portrayal of&nbsp;James Bond. Nevertheless, his two daughters are unlikely to&nbsp;receive any part of&nbsp;this wealth.</p><p>With a&nbsp;background of&nbsp;poverty, having grown up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;sailor father and an&nbsp;art teacher mother, Craig holds the belief that a&nbsp;person should work hard to&nbsp;earn a&nbsp;living. He&nbsp;finds the idea of&nbsp;inheritance unappealing and advocates for people to&nbsp;spend their hard-earned money during their lifetime.</p><p><h2>Sean Connery</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d0a/14c/dff83f5930a09e3ac35666fcbb.jpg><p>Since Sean Connery’s passing in&nbsp;2020, the public has been eagerly anticipating the release of&nbsp;his will to&nbsp;determine if&nbsp;his son was included as&nbsp;an&nbsp;heir. Despite this, Connery made numerous <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>statements </a>during his lifetime that he&nbsp;would disinherit his son with the intention of&nbsp;teaching him a&nbsp;valuable lesson about hard work and self-sufficiency.</p><p>In&nbsp;2007, the actor publicly expressed his desire for his 45-year-old son to&nbsp;become self-sufficient and not rely on&nbsp;his father’s financial support.</p><p><h2>Andrew Lloyd Webber</h2></p><p>Andrew Lloyd Webber, the renowned composer and writer behind hit musicals such as&nbsp;<i>The Phantom of&nbsp;the Opera</i> and <i>Cats</i>, has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>accumulated </a>more than $1&nbsp;billion in&nbsp;earnings throughout his career. Despite this wealth, his five children will not inherit any of&nbsp;it&nbsp;as&nbsp;Webber holds the belief that individuals should work for their own livelihood.</p><p>According to&nbsp;the composer, “It&nbsp;is&nbsp;about having a&nbsp;work ethic&nbsp;— I&nbsp;don’t believe in&nbsp;inherited money at&nbsp;all. I&nbsp;am not in&nbsp;favor of&nbsp;children suddenly finding a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money coming their way because then they have no&nbsp;incentive to&nbsp;work.”</p><p><h2>Philip Seymour Hoffman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ff/4d6/bbd9aa5c94a2cb82a360600afa.jpg><p>The Oscar-winning actor Philip Seymour Hoffman’s will <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>designated </a>only one recipient for his entire fortune, estimated at&nbsp;$35&nbsp;million, his girlfriend and costume designer, Marianne O’Donnell. The couple had three children together, but the actor did not include them in&nbsp;his inheritance plans. His accountant revealed that Hoffman did not want his heirs to&nbsp;experience the feeling of&nbsp;being “trust fund” kids.</p><p><h2>50&nbsp;Cent</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/57b/54f/01320a50ca92189ebaece30862.jpg><p>Rapper&nbsp;50 Cent’s relationship with his son, Marquise, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>has </a>been a&nbsp;source of&nbsp;media attention for some time due to&nbsp;their ongoing disputes. The two regularly air their issues publicly by&nbsp;posting their text exchanges online. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, 50&nbsp;Cent publicly threatened to&nbsp;exclude Marquise from his will.</p><p><h2>Joan Crawford</h2></p><p>The iconic <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> star Joan Crawford was the mother of&nbsp;four adopted children. Upon her death, it&nbsp;was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed </a>that her elder children were left without any inheritance while her entire fortune was passed on&nbsp;to&nbsp;the younger twin siblings. This resulted in&nbsp;legal proceedings, and eventually, the older adopted children received a&nbsp;fair outcome.</p><p><h2>Simon Cowell</h2></p><p>The music industry tycoon, who has produced renowned shows such as&nbsp;T<i>he X&nbsp;Factor, American Idol,</i> and<i> America’s Got Talent</i>, has no&nbsp;intention of&nbsp;leaving an&nbsp;inheritance for his children. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believes </a>that the greatest gift a&nbsp;parent can give to&nbsp;their children is&nbsp;their time and the opportunity to&nbsp;impart their knowledge.</p><p>The producer does not support the idea of&nbsp;passing on&nbsp;his wealth to&nbsp;his offspring. Instead, Cowell prefers to&nbsp;donate the funds to&nbsp;charitable organizations that support children and canine causes.</p><p><h2>Kirk Douglas</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/492/c41/ebddcb5911a6fd6e9b4cc961f4.jpg><p>The actor was known for his philanthropic efforts and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dedication </a>to&nbsp;helping those in&nbsp;need. Alongside his wife, he&nbsp;established a&nbsp;foundation aimed at&nbsp;providing aid to&nbsp;those unable to&nbsp;help themselves. As&nbsp;such, it&nbsp;was not unexpected that the majority of&nbsp;his wealth was designated in&nbsp;his will to&nbsp;be&nbsp;given to&nbsp;charitable causes.</p><p><h2>Laurene Powell Jobs</h2></p><p>The spouse of&nbsp;the late Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, Laurene, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continues </a>to&nbsp;carry on&nbsp;her husband’s legacy. Just as&nbsp;her husband had intended, she has no&nbsp;plans to&nbsp;leave an&nbsp;inheritance to&nbsp;her children. Rather, her aim is&nbsp;to&nbsp;utilize resources in&nbsp;an&nbsp;impactful way.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;successful businessperson, she invests large sums in&nbsp;companies that have the potential to&nbsp;bring about positive change. For instance, in&nbsp;2015, she initiated a&nbsp;program aimed at&nbsp;assisting low-income students in&nbsp;paying for their college education.</p><p><h2>Anderson Cooper</h2></p><p>The prominent American television journalist, Anderson Cooper, has publicly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stated </a>that he&nbsp;will not be&nbsp;leaving his son an&nbsp;inheritance. He&nbsp;believes in&nbsp;the philosophy of&nbsp;his parents, who only provided financial support for his college education, after which he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believes </a>individuals should work hard to&nbsp;achieve their own success.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Marlon Brando</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a95/122/06164e50bfbd893e4f91c56b4e.jpg><p>The well-known actor had 11&nbsp;children, from whom he&nbsp;could have divided his wealth. However, even during his lifetime, he&nbsp;chose to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>disinherit </a>two individuals: his adopted daughter Petra, who he&nbsp;raised starting at&nbsp;age&nbsp;14, and the son of&nbsp;his deceased daughter, Cheyenne.</p><p>The official reasoning behind this decision was never disclosed. However, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>speculated </a>that the actor may have excluded Petra due to&nbsp;her mother suing him for financial compensation. The reason for the actor’s decision to&nbsp;disinherit his grandson remains unknown.</p><p>Would you leave your money to&nbsp;your children, or&nbsp;would you leave them without a&nbsp;penny?
