Taylor won by a 75% landslide, having taken over state radio and using the fear that he could restart the war should he not win.</p><p>He was alleged to have been involved in Sierra Leone’s civil war, trading weapons for blood diamonds. He was charged with aiding and abetting Sierra Leone’s rebel forces atrocities against civilians, which left many thousands dead, with people abducted and tortured. He was also accused of assisting the recruitment of child soldiers.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Siad Barre| Somalia| 1969- 1991</strong></p><p>He took power in a coup d’etat in 1969 and was overthrown in1991while attempting to retake Mogadishu in a military showdown. He was defeated by General Mohamed Farrah Aidid's army.</p><p>Barre left the country without central rule and plunging Somalia into a debilitating civil war that went on for more than 20 years.</p><p>Barre’s rule was characterised by persecution, jailing and torture of political opponents and dissidents.
