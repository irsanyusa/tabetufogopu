If one comes your way, it’s filed differently than income earned from a wage.</p><p>If the income received is subject to self-employment taxes, you may find paying them for the first time a shock. To be prepared for the increase in taxes you’ll need to pay, you may want to consider more robust bookkeeping systems.</p><p>There are many types of 1099s that are treated differently when you file your taxes. If you still need some direction, you may want to consider hiring a tax professional.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What does a 1099 employee mean?</h3><p>Your employer doesn’t classify you as an employee if you’re receiving a 1099. You’re classified as an independent contractor, which is defined by the IRS as a business where the payer can control the outcome of the work, but not how it is done. The Department of Labor (DOL) also notes that classification of a worker depends on whether a person is economically dependent on an employer or if they are in business for themselves.</p><p>Classification of an employee is important. As an employee, you have wage and overtime protection. You pay taxes on your income, and your employer also pays taxes on your income. When you’re classified as a 1099 contractor, you pay both employer and employee taxes on your income, which typically creates a much higher tax burden for you.</p><p>There are many laws regarding proper classification of an employee. Improper classification of an employee is a violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and can be reported to the Department of Labor.</p><h3>Where do I report the information on a 1099 form?</h3><p>Where you report the 1099 information on your Form 1040 will depend on the type of 1099 you received. Some 1099s can be quite complex, so you may want to take a look at the detailed instructions for the type you receive or consider hiring a tax professional. In some instances, there may be multiple places where it may be appropriate to report.</p><h3>Can I ignore the 1099 form?</h3><p>There are certain instances where a 1099 isn’t required to be reported on your tax return. For example, if you received a tax refund in the previous year and were sent a 1099-G, you don’t need to report it if you take the standard deduction. But if you itemize deductions, you do need to report the payment on your income tax return.</p><p>Take a look at the tax form instructions for the 1099 you received to see if it may not need to be filed. However, if you do not report income from a 1099, you’ll likely receive a bill from the IRS.</p><h5><strong>The Lili Visa® Debit Cards is issued by Sunrise Banks N.A., Member FDIC, pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A.
