She’s had a&nbsp;very special <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with her sister, and once she found out that her sister is&nbsp;infertile, she could feel nothing but a&nbsp;total joy. Let’s take a&nbsp;deeper look at&nbsp;what’s been happening between these two women that resulted in&nbsp;such a&nbsp;whimsical turn of&nbsp;their lives.</p><p><h2>The relationship between the two sisters has been tough since childhood.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/68a/890/712a725ae49fdc706871afe626.jpg><p>A&nbsp;woman named Anna wrote to&nbsp;us, telling her very complex story that developed from her complicated relationship with her sister. She began her letter saying that she’s 26&nbsp;years old, and she has an&nbsp;older sister, Vanessa, who’s 28&nbsp;and whom Anna has never loved. The woman explains that Vanessa always wanted to&nbsp;compete with her, but this desire has never had even a&nbsp;hint of&nbsp;normal sibling rivalry.</p><p>Their whole life, the older sister seemed resentful of&nbsp;Anna’s very existence. She wanted the <a href=# title=spotlight data-link=tag>spotlight</a> to&nbsp;always shine only on&nbsp;her. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, Vanessa stepped on&nbsp;everything that Anna loved and enjoyed. When Anna learned violin, Vanessa had to&nbsp;learn violin. When the younger sister excelled at&nbsp;some subject, the older one suddenly became an&nbsp;expert in&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;Anna had a&nbsp;crush, Vanessa would be&nbsp;dating that very same guy in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few days.</p><p>Anna admits that she had always told her parents when her older sister did this but all her pleas were ignored, because, as&nbsp;their parents said, sisters tend to&nbsp;copy each other and Anna can’t prohibit Vanessa doing what she likes. The older sister always kept an&nbsp;eye on&nbsp;what activities Anna did, and even the <a href=# title=clothes data-link=tag>clothes</a> she wore, so&nbsp;she could out-do her sister.</p><p><h2>As&nbsp;the sisters were growing&nbsp;up, their rivalry was becoming even more intense.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c60/096/1311b054ddaa02b2e83d6ddc45.jpg><p>Anna continues her story, saying that there was also more praise for Vanessa in&nbsp;everything. Even when the younger sister took the initiative to&nbsp;begin any activity first, the older one was praised because she was performing nicer in&nbsp;it. Their parents would take time off from work to&nbsp;attend Vanessa’s dance shows, visiting every single one, because they took the greatest pride in&nbsp;her dancing achievements. But as&nbsp;for Anna, the parents attended maybe 3&nbsp;or 4&nbsp;of&nbsp;hers because they were “busy at&nbsp;work” or&nbsp;had some other important plans.</p><p>Vanessa took advantage from this. She was constantly sweet with Anna around their parents. Whenever they weren’t around, she told Anna how much she hated her and how she should have stopped trying because she would always be&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;second place after her. She also teased Anna in&nbsp;<a href=# title=school data-link=tag>school</a>. Vanessa often tripped her, threw things at&nbsp;her, and did other offensive things to&nbsp;Anna on&nbsp;an&nbsp;almost daily basis.</p><p><h2>Anna always felt out of&nbsp;place because of&nbsp;her older sister.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b43/7d4/d19913563dba502c58b550cb4a.jpg><p>The school employees reacted to&nbsp;that bad teasing, threatening Vanessa with suspension, but their parents justified their older daughter’s behavior every time. They constantly explained to&nbsp;the school administration that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;family matter and the girls were just bickering like all other sisters.</p><p>Anna was often in&nbsp;trouble as&nbsp;Vanessa would start crying, saying how she was mistreated at&nbsp;school when Anna confronted her. The younger sister became an&nbsp;outsider due to&nbsp;the older sister’s malicious rumors about her, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was nearly impossible for her to&nbsp;make <a href=# title=friends data-link=tag>friends</a>. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, Anna befriended only people from other districts. Vanessa was telling lies to&nbsp;all Anna’s friends about how Anna was favored by&nbsp;their parents and that it&nbsp;was Anna who always teased and belittled her.</p><p>Anna revealed that her sister even stole her boyfriends doing this. She told them that Anna was an&nbsp;awful person that copied her every step.</p><p><h2>Vanessa is&nbsp;now living through the worst times of&nbsp;her life, but Anna doesn’t feel sorry for her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/019/f6a/facf3a56a1b3cd467856cf49ec.jpg><p>Anna continues her story, saying that she’s now happily married to&nbsp;a&nbsp;very nice and loving guy. Her whole family hadn’t even attended her wedding and didn’t even congratulate her. Anna has 3&nbsp;<a href=# title=kids data-link=tag>kids</a>, but her parents haven’t made any attempt to&nbsp;contact or&nbsp;meet them during these years.</p><p>Vanessa, in&nbsp;her turn, got married to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the guys who was initially Anna’s boyfriend. They were together since high school, and she seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy with him. But her sister has been posting about her infertility issues and says that she’s sad that their parents “won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;hold their first beloved baby.”</p><p>Anna describes her emotions, writing, “I’m <strong>happy Vanessa is&nbsp;suffering</strong>. I&nbsp;am happy that she <strong>will never be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother</strong>. If&nbsp;she did all this tormenting to&nbsp;me&nbsp;for years, what would she do&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;child? Especially if&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;girl. I&nbsp;don’t wish anything bad or&nbsp;evil on&nbsp;any baby on&nbsp;Earth, but&nbsp;I know in&nbsp;heart of&nbsp;hearts that <strong>Vanessa’s child would be&nbsp;destroyed by&nbsp;her</strong>. I&nbsp;don’t have any sympathy or&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;obligation to&nbsp;my&nbsp;sister and to&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents. They always supported her and belittled&nbsp;me.</p><p>My&nbsp;parents cared more about my&nbsp;sister’s miscarriage than my&nbsp;three children. My&nbsp;kids always ask why they only have one set of&nbsp;grandparents. I&nbsp;will never express any condolences to&nbsp;my&nbsp;destructive sister, who has been justified in&nbsp;her awful deeds since birth. Maybe her problems will change her, maybe she’ll develop empathy or&nbsp;any kind of&nbsp;emotion that isn’t hate.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ee/978/8db4d256069c5fe01935e5ec80.jpg><p><h2>We&nbsp;advise Anna to&nbsp;still try to&nbsp;support her sister.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ca/467/d4bae653bbac7d613fa52434df.jpg><p>We’re very grateful to&nbsp;Anna for her trust and sharing her story with&nbsp;us. As&nbsp;difficult as&nbsp;it&nbsp;seems, we’d advise Anna to&nbsp;still show some kindness and understanding to&nbsp;her sister Vanessa. It&nbsp;may seem almost impossible, provided that Vanessa was actually a&nbsp;person who ruined Anna’s childhood, but we’d advise Anna to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;talk with Vanessa.</p><p>It&nbsp;doesn’t mean that she must totally forget about everything that her older sister did to&nbsp;her, but Anna might feel better in&nbsp;her heart if&nbsp;she appears more kind and sympathetic than her sister. Sometimes, it’s not necessary to&nbsp;copy someone’s bad deeds and seek revenge. Showing some kindness to&nbsp;your offender might teach them even a&nbsp;better lesson than mirroring their own bad deeds.</p><p>And here’s yet another shocking story about a&nbsp;relationship between siblings. This man’s sister refused to&nbsp;invite his son to&nbsp;the <a href=#>wedding</a> because of&nbsp;his appearance, and the reaction of&nbsp;everyone was just outrageous.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6edKiqq2domK2tHnIp52eqqSeuaZ5wKebZqGdYrWivM%2ByZJqan6rBbrXTZp%2BeqpWoeri02GZvam9jbINw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./how-many-castles-in-germany.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How many castles are in Germany?">&larr;
